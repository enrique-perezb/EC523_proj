ENGEC 523 Project: Age prediction models for AD classification

We are testing 3 different models. The implementation of each is in a different directory:
1. 3D CNN using weighted T1 MRI images.

2. GAT implemented on features extracted from T1 MRI images.

3. GNN implemented on structural connectivity matrix comming from diffusion MRI.
